# 🎯 REALISTIC SYNTHETIC DATASET FOR MODEL ACCURACY TESTING

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT PRIVACY NOTE**

**Why Synthetic Data Instead of Real Users:**
- **Privacy Protection:** Real user data requires consent and raises privacy concerns
- **Legal Compliance:** Using actual LinkedIn/Instagram data may violate terms of service
- **Ethical Research:** Synthetic data allows testing without compromising user privacy
- **Reproducible Results:** Controlled synthetic data enables consistent evaluation

**Our Solution:** Highly realistic synthetic data that mimics real-world patterns for accurate model testing.
